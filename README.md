# WSN-Nodes-Location-Optimiation
This code optimize the location of WSN nodes after coverage hole is generated due to depleted battery. If any node in the actie communication dies then rest nodes are positioned again by PSO optimization cosnidering the coverage area maximiation as the objective function.
